# OpenZeppelin Documentation

Learn about writing, testing, deploying, and upgrading your smart contract applications on Ethereum using the OpenZeppelin tools.

Our offering includes the most widely used Solidity smart contracts library, a command-line tool for managing your project, several JavaScript modules, and pre-packaged boxes to bootstrap development.

## Why OpenZeppelin?

OpenZeppelin tools have been built with **security in mind**. Since the first release of the Contracts library in 2016, our libraries have been downloaded over 1.5 million times to create tokens, protect digital assets, and power decentralized applications, securing more than $4.5 billion. We also work with top Ethereum projects through our [security audits service](https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/).

### Audits

The OpenZeppelin Research team provides a [Security Audits](https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/) service for decentralized applications, tools, and protocols. You can browse through past public audits in [our blog](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/security-audits/). Go through our [quality checklist](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/follow-this-quality-checklist-before-an-audit-8cc6a0e44845/) and [contact us](mailto:audits@openzeppelin.com) before [going to production](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/preparing-for-mainnet) to make sure your project is secure.

### Ethernaut

Learn more about security in Solidity contracts by playing [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/). Every level in Ethernaut is a smart contract waiting to be hacked, and teaches you a vulnerability by having you exploit it - many of them based on real-life hacks! You can discuss your solutions or ask for tips in [our forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/c/security/ethernaut/30).
